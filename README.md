I have done multiple courses to expand my knowledge to become a Back-end Developer.
The main course (Meta Back-end Developer Professional Certificate) that I followed, is devided in 9 courses which will give a certificate for each of them.
The included courses are:
- Introduction to Back-End Development
- Programming in Python
- Version Control
- Introduction to Databases for Back-End Development
- Djange Web Framework
- APIs
- The full Stack

In the end I've received my professional certificate that includes all of them.

Furthermore, I have done two small courses:
